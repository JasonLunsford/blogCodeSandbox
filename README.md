<h1>Blog Code Sandbox</h1>

<p>My simple solution to an annoying problem: where can I build some simple demo code for my next blog?</p>

<p>Yes you can use one of any of online resources - but if you like to build your code offline, locally, or in the same environment you happen to be writing about, then this solution may be for you.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
